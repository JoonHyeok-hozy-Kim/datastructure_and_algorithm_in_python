# Part 13. Text Processing
## 13.1 Abundance of Digitized Text
#### Ex.) Common examples of digital collections that include textual information
* Snapshots of the World Wide Web, as Internet document formats HTML and XML are primarily text formats, with added tags for multimedia content 
* All documents stored locally on a user’s computer
* Email archives
* Customer reviews
* Compilations of status updates on social networking sites such as Facebook
* Feeds from microblogging sites such as Twitter and Tumblr These collections include written text from hundreds of international

#### Materials that will be covered
1. brute-force method
   * Goal : Dealing with the problem of searching for a pattern as a substring of a larger piece of text
2. dynamic programming
   * Goal : Can be applied in certain settings to solve a problem in polynomial time that appears at first to require exponential time to solve
3. greedy method
   * Goal : Compressing text data in order to minimize the number of bits that need to be communicated through a network and to reduce the long-term storage requirements for archives

### 13.1.1 Notations for Strings and the Python str Class
#### Notation1) Σ
* The set of alphabet that a string contains
  * ex.) 
    * For S = "CGTAAACTGCTTTAATCAAACGC"
    * Σ = {A,C,G,T}.
* If the alphabet is in fixed size, we denote |Σ|.
